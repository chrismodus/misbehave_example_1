# Misbehave project example 1

## This is an example repository for testing Misbehave.

The feature folder structure isolates each feature meaning the features cannot be run with 
 > python manage.py behave

but only by providing a url to feature folder
 > python manage.py behave BDD/Features/user_test_folder/
